This is a consolidated React/Vite workspace for the Learning to Learn dashboard, mentorship search experience, and project builder template flow that power the L2L Independent Study Demo. The original project is available at https://www.figma.com/design/kGzwWqsgq3y9HTmGfxwvW7/L2L-Independent-Study-Demo---Iteration-1-Demo.
